<h1>Operating Systems: Timeline and Family Tree</h1>
<h2>Includes about 1,130 operating systems so far</h2>
<p style="color: red; font-size: small;">Last updated: August 2024</p>
<p>In this post you'll find a family tree and timeline of operating systems. I have tried to include all operating systems, no matter how old or obscure. Of course, a complete list is virtually impossible, as there is no way to catalogue all the tiny hobby and embedded systems that may exist somewhere.<br /><br />
Please also note that I only included a few selected Linux/BSD/Solaris distributions (it is arguable whether these should count as an OS on their own or not).<br /><br />
Currently, the family tree includes between around 1,120 different operating systems (including some renamings). Tip: use Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) to search for a system.</p>

<p><strong>There are some missing system and some corrections that are not included in the graphic below yet. <a href="https://github.com/eylenburg/eylenburg.github.io/issues/80" target"_blank">Please see here for the issue tracker.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>If anyone would like to make corrections, please feel tell me.</strong><br />
<i>Big Update August 2021: Thank you for everyone e-mailing me with suggestions after this webpage got posted on Hackernews by someone. I have added most of the suggestions, such as missing operating systems and a few mistakes.</i><br />
<i>Big Update February 2023: I added another 200 or so operating systems and made some corrections.</i><br />
<i>Update July 2024: I added another 30-ish operating systems and made some corrections and updates.</p>
