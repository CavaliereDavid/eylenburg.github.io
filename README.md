If you want to contribute via pull request:
- The HTML tables should be straightforward to update but please also amend the "last updated: DD MMM YYYY" at the top of the table and, if necessary, the "last updated: MMM YYYY" on the index.html
- The OS Family Tree has a [separate repo](https://github.com/eylenburg/os-family-tree) for the data.
- The Browser Engines Timeline and Default Desktop Environments graphics are custom-made in Excel and therefore not very suitable for direct contributions.
